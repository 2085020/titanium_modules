Place your assets like PNG files in this directory and they will be packaged with your module.

If you create a file named com.appcelerator.tipython.js in this directory, it will be 
compiled and used as your module.  This allows you to run pure Javascript
modules that are pre-compiled.

com.appcelerator.tipython.js is a renamed version of the /dist/skulpt.js file
from skulpt.org with a few modifications to enabled usage in Titanium.
