Place your assets like PNG files in this directory and they will be packaged with your module.

If you create a file named com.appcelerator.tiphp.js in this directory, it will be 
compiled and used as your module.  This allows you to run pure Javascript
modules that are pre-compiled.

com.appcelerator.tiphp.js is a renamed version of the php.default.namespaced.min.js 
package (http://phpjs.org/packages/index) with a few modifications to enabled usage 
in Titanium.
